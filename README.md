# N64-PD-ROMS

### A repository of public domain ROMs for the Nintendo 64

All of the ROMs in this repository are public domain unless stated otherwise.

Another good source is [Peter Lemon's N64 test ROMs](https://github.com/PeterLemon/N64)

If there are any ROMs I have forgotten, or if you think any of the ROMs have issues, please let me know by emailing me or creating an issue.

## ROMs with nudity
I decided I will not have any ROMs with nudity in this repository. That might offend people, break GitHub's terms, or generally get me in trouble.

If it were up to me, I would still upload them since they are technically a good benchmark/test ROM since they decode JPEG images and a bunch of other fancy stuff. 

I am not offended by them because I am not offended by nudity, or the human body in general. Not that I want you to send me pictures of your nads or anything, I am just saying in the grand scheme of things, it's a ROM. Not a big deal. Anyway, I have those ROMs too if anybody wants them. Just email me. :D
